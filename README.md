# PsychoPy Workshops
Three lab sessions where we go over some basics of psychopy and how we can leverage python to use scripts to make those psychopy experiments more efficient 

There are three python scripts written outside of psychopy, a builder mode recreation of one of the tasks, and a python compiled script of that same builder task. In all three tasks, there are timed visual stimuli, responses in some form, and timed fixation and regulation cues.
